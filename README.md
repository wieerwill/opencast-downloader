# OpenCast Downloader

## Quick and easy note
Some universitys are using this OpenCast Player for their videos but have them password protected. As this python programm can't handle redirection links there is a easy workaround without any further tools:
Open the video in the common OpenCast-Player in Firefox-Browser. Press F12 for developer tools and open the "network"-tab. Reload the page and scroll up (sorting for "media"-type makes it even easier). There is a .mp4 file that can be opened in a new tab via right-click on it. As Firefox features mp4-video-download just right click the video in the new opened tab and you can save it to whereever you want.

##
If your university uses OpenCast for lecture videos and you're looking for a simple-to-use downloader so you can save these lecture videos to your mobile devices and use them on the go, this tool is for you!

## Prerequisites

To use this tool, you will need Python 3 on your system with the `requests` module installed. (If the module is missing from your Python installation, it will be installed automatically.)

## Usage

The Python script is run by `./oc_download.py` or `python3 oc_download.py`. It offers an interactive menu, however, by specifying all of the appropriate optional flags, you can run this script unattended. For options, please refer to the help output:

    usage: oc_download.py [-h] [-U URL] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD]
                        [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [-r RESOLUTION] [-s SERIES] [-ls]
                        [-le] [-e EPISODES] [-pr] [-pn]

    Downloads videos from an OpenCast sever.
